# Bonus Content - Callbacks

Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe tasks that callbacks can do while a model is training
- Create a callback and assign it to a model's training
- Use a ModelCheckpoint object to save model parameters during training
- Use the EarlyStopping callback to keep a model from overfitting
- Describe an example where you may want to create a custom callback
- Implement a custom callback to detect overfitting
