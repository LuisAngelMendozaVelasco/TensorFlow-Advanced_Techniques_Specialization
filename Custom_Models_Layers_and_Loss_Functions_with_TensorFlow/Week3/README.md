# Custom Layers

Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.

## Learning Objectives

- Define a custom layer to include the activation function
- Define a custom layer class by inheriting from the Layer class
- Describe the two components of a custom layer
- Describe what a custom layer can do that a lambda layer cannot
- Use a lambda layer to customize a network layer
