# Custom Loss Functions

Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe when you need to build a custom loss function
- Implement Huber Loss with a custom loss function
- Add an adjustable hyper parameter to custom loss using a wrapper function
- Define a custom loss using an object oriented class
- Implement contrastive loss function used in a Siamese network
