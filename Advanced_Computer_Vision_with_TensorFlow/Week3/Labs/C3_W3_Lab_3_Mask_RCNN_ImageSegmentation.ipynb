This means that aside from the bounding boxes, the model is also able to predict segmentation masks for each instance of a class in the image. You have already encountered most of the commands here when you worked with the Object Dection API and you will see how you can use it with instance segmentation models. Let's begin!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VNlKYq2x4fa0"},"source":["*Note: You should use a TPU runtime for this colab because of the processing requirements for this model.

That will be converted first to masks that will overlay to the full image size.\n","* You will also select mask pixel values that are above a certain threshold. We picked a value of `0.6` but feel free to modify this and see what results you will get. If you pick something lower, then you'll most likely notice mask pixels that are outside the object.\n","* As you've seen before, you can use `visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array()` to plot the results on the image. The difference this time is the parameter `instance_masks` and you will pass in the reframed detection boxes to see the segmentation masks on the image.\n","\n","You can see how all these are handled in the code below.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"Y-e89eLPzjF2","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":964,"output_embedded_package_id":"1kdN_2AuHv2SpXtus8kbHfvJn6aG2gTZd"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725936139937,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":9817,"user":{"displayName":"Luis Angel Mendoza Velasco","userId":"04238134014498579171"}},"outputId":"32cc9451-4be4-485a-9747-f665fc77a258"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}],"source":["# Handle models with masks:\n","label_id_offset = 0\n","image_np_with_mask = image_np.copy()\n","\n","if 'detection_masks' in result:\n","    # Convert np.arrays to tensors\n","    detection_masks = tf.convert_to_tensor(result['detection_masks'][0])\n","    detection_boxes = tf.convert_to_tensor(result['detection_boxes'][0])\n","\n","    # Reframe the the bounding box mask to the image size.\n","    detection_masks_reframed = utils_ops.reframe_box_masks_to_image_masks(detection_masks, detection_boxes,\n","                                                                          image_np.shape[1], image_np.shape[2])\n","\n","    # Filter mask pixel values that are above a specified threshold\n","    detection_masks_reframed = tf.cast(detection_masks_reframed > 0.6, tf.uint8)\n","\n","    # Get the numpy array\n","    result['detection_masks_reframed'] = detection_masks_reframed.numpy()\n","\n","# Overlay labeled boxes and segmentation masks on the image\n","viz_utils.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(image_np_with_mask[0],\n","                                                    result['detection_boxes'][0],\n","                                                    (result['detection_classes'][0] + label_id_offset).astype(int),\n","                                                    result['detection_scores'][0],\n","                                                    category_index,\n","                                                    use_normalized_coordinates=True,\n","                                                    max_boxes_to_draw=100,\n","                                                    min_score_thresh=0.7,\n","                                                    agnostic_mode=False,\n","                                                    instance_masks=result.get('detection_masks_reframed', None),\n","                                                    line_thickness=8)\n","\n","plt.figure(figsize=(24,32))\n","plt.imshow(image_np_with_mask[0])\n","plt.axis(\"off\")\n","plt.show()"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"TPU","colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"V28"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
