# Introduction to Computer Vision

Get a conceptual overview of image classification, object localization, object detection, and image segmentation. Also be able to describe multi-label classification, and distinguish between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. In the rest of this course, you will apply TensorFlow to build object detection and image segmentation models.

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish between object localization and object detection
- Distinguish between object detection and image segmentation
- Distinguish between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation
- Explain what is transfer learning and why it's used
- Describe design options when using transfer learning
- Implement object localization with a CNN
- Implement an image classifier with transfer learning
