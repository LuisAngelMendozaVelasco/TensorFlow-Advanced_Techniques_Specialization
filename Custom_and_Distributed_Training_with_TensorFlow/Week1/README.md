# Differentiation and Gradients

This week, you will get a detailed look at the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow - tensor objects. For example, you will be able to describe the difference between eager mode and graph mode in TensorFlow, and explain why eager mode is very user friendly for you as a developer. You will also use TensorFlow tools to calculate gradients so that you don’t have to look for your old calculus textbooks next time you need to get a gradient!

## Learning Objectives

- Use various TensorFlow functions to create tensor objects
- Describe the difference between graph-based execution and eager execution in TensorFlow
- Use TensorFlow’s GradientTape to calculate derivatives of loss functions
