# Graph Mode

This week, you’ll learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in “graph mode”. You’ll take a peek at what graph code looks like, and you’ll practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools, so that you don’t have to write the graph code yourself!

## Learning Objectives

- Describe when graph mode code is preferred over eager mode code
- Use decorators and tf.autograph to convert code into graph based code
