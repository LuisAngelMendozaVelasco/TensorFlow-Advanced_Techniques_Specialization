# Custom Training

This week, you will build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets. Being able to write your own training loops will give you more flexibility and visibility with your model training. You will also use a function to calculate the derivatives of functions so that you donâ€™t have to look to your old calculus textbooks to calculate gradients.

## Learning Objectives

- Define the steps in a custom training loop
- Implement custom training loops using GradientTape
- Implement a custom training loop with data from TensorFlow Datasets
