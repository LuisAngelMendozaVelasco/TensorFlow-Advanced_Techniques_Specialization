# Week 4: GANs

This week, you’ll learn about GANs. You'll learn what they are, who invented them, their architecture and how they vary from VAEs. You'll get to see the function of the generator and the discriminator within the model, and the concept of 2 training phases and the role of introduced noise. Then you'll end the week building your own GAN that can generate faces! How cool is that!

## Learning Objectives

- Design your first GAN architecture
- Train a GAN
- Build your first GAN
- Build a DCGAN on Fashion MNIST
- Build a face generator GAN on the Celebrity dataset
