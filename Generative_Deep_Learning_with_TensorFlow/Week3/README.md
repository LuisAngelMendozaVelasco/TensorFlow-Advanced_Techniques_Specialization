# Week 3: Variational AutoEncoders

This week you will explore Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to generate entirely new data. In this week’s assignment, you will generate anime faces and compare them against reference images.

## Learning Objectives

- Train your own VAE model
- Use a loss function to calculate the loss value
- Use a decoder to generate new data
- Use a sample layer to encode the architecture
- Describe the VAE architecture and code
- Define variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)
